# TILTING TABLE
Actually this project was built for a **"Useless Project" competition**.      
Imagine a table that absolutely refuses to hold anything you place on it. 
The moment an object dares to land on its surface, an ultrasonic sensor springs into action, detecting the intruder as an “obstacle.”
Without hesitation, the table’s top tilts dramatically — powered by servo motors — sending the object sliding right off. 
Once the coast is clear, the tabletop calmly returns to its original position, ready to reject the next unfortunate item. 
It’s the perfect blend of engineering, mischief, and pure pointlessness
