# TILTING TABLE
Actually this project was built for a **"Useless Project" competition**.  
It’s just a table that **throws away objects** instead of keeping them.  
If something comes within **50 cm** of the ultrasonic sensor, the servos tilt the table and drop the object.  

## Components
- Arduino Uno 
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- 2 × Servo Motors
- Jumper Wires
